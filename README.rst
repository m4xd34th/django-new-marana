Usage
------

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/the3ballsoft/django-new-marana.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a Django project for you.


**Warning**: After this point, change 'Your name', 'the3ballsoft@gmail.com', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them::

    author_name [Your Name]: Antinogeno Martinez
    email [Your email]: antinogeno@yahoo.es
    description [A short description of the project.]: A reddit clone.


Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd reddit/
    $ ls

Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:the3ballsoft/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?


For Readers of Two Scoops of Django 1.8
--------------------------------------------

You may notice that some elements of this project do not exactly match what we describe in chapter 3. The reason for that is this project, amongst other things, serves as a test bed for trying out new ideas and concepts. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but the end result is that it won't necessarily match precisely what is described in the book I co-authored.
